### AirBnB clone - The console

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface like in a
Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

## What's a command Interpreter?
Do you remember the shell? It's exactly the same but limited to a specific
use-case.

We want to be able to manage our project:
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
- Do operations on objects
- update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
